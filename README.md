# proyecto_asir_2021

Here you can see all the files used to my project of GS-ASIR at last school year.

It is about have remote control of different services in the Raspberry Pi 3B (or any other).
Using a Telegram Bot, with a simple local Python script.

And using some GPIO to turn ON or OFF a LEDs, just for indicate if a service assigned to it, is working right now.

And with Systemctl, you can manage the services that runs the LEDs, without affect the service that LEDs are looking for.
